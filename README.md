# Shakespearean-Text

A recurrent nueral network with two Gated Recurrent Units and one Time distributed Dense layer is trained on the "Shakespearean text" dataset. The model is used to generate Shakespearean text by predicting the next letter at each step and appending the letter to the input and the process continues.
This is an implementation of Mr. Andrej Karpathy's method to train an RNN to predict the next character in a sequence.
